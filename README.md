# Web3 Dev Journey 🚀

This repository documents my journey into Web3 development — one step, one week, and one project at a time.

## 👋 Introduction
Hi, I'm **Samuel Ayokanmi**. I love building and learning, and I'm diving into the Web3 ecosystem to channel my passion for development into something impactful.

## 🛠️ Weekly Projects

Each week, I'll be building a project to strengthen my skills:

1. ✅ A Landing Page for a DAO  
2. 🔄 A React Crypto Dashboard  
3. 🔄 Deploy a 'Greet Me' Smart Contract  
4. 🔄 Build a Decentralized Guestbook dApp

- Week 2: React dashboard using CoinGecko API
- Week 3: Write/deploy smart contract (Solidity + Remix)
- Week 4: Combine frontend + contract (Ethereum + web3.js or ethers.js)

## 💡 Capstone
A complete dApp that brings together everything I've learned!
